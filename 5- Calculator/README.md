Challenge-5: Calculator

Remember the tip calculator challenge ?
Let's create a more advanced version using everyting we learned:

This time, John & his family went to 5 different restaurants.
The bills were $24, $48, $268, $180 and $42.

John likes to tip 20% of the bill when the bill is less than $50, 
                  15% when the bill is between $50 and $200, and
                  10% if the bill is more than $200.
                  
Implement a tip calculator using objects and loops:
1. Create an object w/ an array for the bill values
2. Add a method to calculate the tip
3. This method should include a loop to iterate over all the paid bills and do the tip calculations.
4. As an output, create 1) a new array containing all tips, and
                        2) an array containing final paid amounts (bill * tip).
   
   HINT: Start w/ two empty arrays [] as properties and then fill them up in the loop. 

EXTRA AFTER FINISHING:

5. Create a function (not a method) to calculate the average of a given array of tips.
   HINT: Loop over the array, and in each iteration store the current sum in a variable (starting from 8).
   After you have the sum of the array, divide it by the number of elements in it (that's how you calculate the average)
6. Calculate the average of John's Family Tips
7. Log to the console the average of John's Tips
